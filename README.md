# Learning-ARM
Some code examples to learn how to use an ARM chip, mostly the stm32f103 (blue and black pill), and esp32. At this moment this repo contains examples with stm32duino, using PlatformIO and VScode. [Mbed simulator](http://ec2-52-211-146-247.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:7829/) deserves a try.
